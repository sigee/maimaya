 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is the
first thing I should know?</span><br>
<br>
The Nightmare 3 Bundle is NOT DEAD SOULS. It is the Nightmare 3 mudlib,<br>
which is a completely different set of files than those distributed<br>
with Dead Souls. I, Cratylus, am not the author of Nightmare 3, and<br>
you can consider this an official disclaim of any credit for its<br>
brilliance or blame for its pitfalls.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="2"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is the
second thing I should know?</span><br>
<br>
The Nightmare 3 mudlib is copyrighted material and is not public domain.<br>
Do not ask me for permission to modify/distribute/fork, whatever. I<br>
am not the author and connot grant that permission. All I have done<br>
is tweak it so that it will work. I am not the Nightmare maintainer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="3"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Who is this for?</span><br>
<br>
The Nightmare 3 bundle is absolutely not for newbie admins. This<br>
is not intended to be a "get started on your own mud the<br>
easy way!" sort of deal. I am making it available as a <br>
courtesy and favor to mudlib hobbyists who have an interest<br>
in tinkering with this lib. But if what you're looking for<br>
is a quick-start kit for your own mud, I strongly recommend<br>
you stop reading now and look elsewhere, because even though<br>
the Nightmare 3 Bundle makes installation easi<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ER</span>,
it does not<br>
necessarily make it ea<span style="font-weight: bold;">SY</span>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="4"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is
Nightmare 3?</span><br>
<br>
You'll want to refer to the <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_Mudlib">Wikipedia article</a>
on this. It's a<br>
lib for which many LPC old timers have a nostalgic fondness.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="5"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Aren't you the
Dead Souls maintainer? What's your angle here?</span><br>
<br>
I am indeed the maintainer of a different mudlib<br>
called Dead Souls (which I am not ashamed to plug<br>
here by pointing you to <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Souls_MUDlib">its Wikipedia
entry</a>). However, I<br>
have a general affection for the LP mud codebase family.<br>
During some experimentation I found that I had a<br>
relatively easier way of installing Nightmare 3 that people<br>
could take advantage of, and it seemed like a nice thing<br>
to do, making it available generally.<br>
<br>
I'm not afraid that people will use Nightmare 3 instead of<br>
Dead Souls. For one thing, I think that "more LPmuds",<br>
regardless of the codebase, is a net plus for DS. And<br>
anyway, what kind of lib author would I be, if I was<br>
afraid to let people compare my work side by side with that<br>
of others? Let the chips fall where they may.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="6"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why were you
working on Nightmare 3?</span><br>
<br>
During Dead Souls development I decided to take a serious look<br>
other libs after experiencing success experimenting with<br>
Discworld lib. I got a bit carried away, I'm afraid, and<br>
decided to see what else I could bundle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="7"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Well, you
wasted your time. It doesn't work.</span><br>
<br>
There is such a vast and bewildering array of operating<br>
system and development software and system hardware architecture<br>
combinations out there that there is simply no way for<br>
me to guarantee that the bundle will work for everyone...<br>
or indeed for most.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't work out of the box, please note</big><big
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"> that you<br>
are on your own. Very few people still know or care about<br>
Nightmare 3, and if you decide to pick it up as your<br>
home lib, please do so with the understanding that you<br>
are a Do It Yourself iconoclast who will have to work<br>
out their own lib issues.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="9"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">No, really,
where can I get
support for Nightmare 3?</span><br>
<br>
Once it is installed, it might not be unreasonable to<br>
ask for advice on the imud_code line. You may need to<br>
set up another mud with access to I3 for this purpose.<br>
As of this writing, Nightmare 3 may not fully support I3.<br>
<br>
You're also welcome to visit the <a href="http://lpmuds.net/forum/">LPMuds.net</a>
discussion forum<br>
and chat there, but don't expect quick turnaround on your<br>
questions. Nightmare 3 experts are fewer and farther between<br>
than they once were, so you may have to wait a little<br>
for a helpful response.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a
 name="10"></a>I work with Nightmare 3 all the time. It's not that
hard to
set up.</span><br>
<br>
The small driver and lib tweaks necessary to<br>
get Nightmare 3 compiled and run on a modern system aren't<br>
that big a deal, but it seemed like a nice thing to do anyway.<br>
<br>
I should note, however, that if you are not LPC leet, getting<br>
Nightmare 3 to run on MudOS 22.2b14 actually is not that<br>
trivial. I would suggest you give it a try yourself<br>
sometime, without looking at how I did it. That should <br>
kill a rainy Sunday.<br>
<br>
Many people will still run into problems, I'm sure, but<br>
even for those, this should get them far closer to the ballpark.<br>

			 Nightmare Mudlib 3.3
		     for the MudOS Driver v20.23
		      Released 13 December 1994

/* NOTE: 950118
   I have included the options.h from my compile now.  This is the
   options.h you should use compiling your driver.  Only change
   the config file dir define.

The Nightmare Mudlib 3.3 is designed to be released with a beta driver
from MudOS.  This is an unusual occurrence, as I prefer to release
with MudOS fill releases.  Nightmare and MudOS have gone through so
many changes, and with a pending release of Nightmare IV, I decided to
go ahead and release Nightmare 3.3.  The only driver with which this
is tested and proven is MudOS v20.23.  Do not use anything else until
you understand what upgrading a driver involves.

The Nightmare Mudlib 3.3 can be found in the sub-directory called
mudlib.  In addition to the mudlib, this packages comes with a
configuration script to help configure the mudlib for your system.
This script is a perl script, and it requires that perl is installed
on your system in order to run it.  If perl is not installed on your
system, you can still install the mudlib easily, just not as easily
:).

COMPILING MUDOS
Nightmare 3.3 uses options unused by previous instances of the
Nightmare Mudlib or by other mudlibs.  Therefore you should look at
the options.h file included with the mudlib before compiling the
driver and editing your own version of options.h.  Do not use our
actual copy, as it is only a sample which may be out of date.  Just
use it as a guide for filling in information.

INSTALLATION
If perl is installed on your system:

1) Check to see that line 1 of Configure points to the actual location
of perl on your system.  On some systems it might be in /bin/perl or
/usr/bin/perl.

2) Type ./Configure.

3) Answer the questions it asks.

4) Once the mud starts, go to step 4 of the no-perl instructions.

If perl is not installed on your system:

1) Compile the MudOS Driver v20.23.  If it did not come with your
package, then you can get it from actlab.rtf.utexas.edu.  Refer to the
documentation with the driver on information about compiling it. 

2) The driver will have produced a file called "driver".  You should
be able simply to type make install after making it so that the driver
file is moved to its final resting place.  If not, then move it there
yourself.

3) Copy Config.NM33 to your config file directory.  You specified this
when you edited options.h before compiling the driver.  Edit it,
giving it values that relate specifically to you and your MUD.

4) Type: "driver Config.NM33 &" at the UNIX command line.  You will
get a bunch of messages.  Ignore them so long as after about 30
seconds you see the message "connected to port whatever" or something
like that, where whatever is the port on which you want your mud.

5) Telnet to that port.  You will be asked several questions about
your character.  Your character will be made an admin.  Once the
questions are done, YOU WILL BE DISCONNECTED.  Telnet again.  When you
reconnect, you will get a normal login screen.  Login, and you are
set.

       The privs_file() function is called in the  master  object
       when  a new file is created.  The `filename' of the object
       is  passed  as  the  argument,   and   the   string   that
       privs_file()  returns  is  used  as the new object's privs
       string.

       The privs_file() functionality is only  available  if  the
       driver is compiled with the PRIVS option defined.

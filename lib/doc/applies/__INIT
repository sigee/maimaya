__INIT(4)                 Driver Applies                __INIT(4)

       When the driver compiles an object that contains  variable
       declarations  that  initialize  the  variables,  then  the
       driver inserts a function named __INIT() in  the  compiled
       object  in  which  the initializations are performed.  For
       example, in the following object:

         int x = 3;

         void
         create()
         {
            write(x + "\n");
         }

       the driver would translate it into the following  internal
       form before compiling the object:

         int x;

         __INIT()
         {
            x = 3;
         }

         void
         create()
         {
            write(x + "\n");
         }

       If  you  add  a  function  named  __INIT()  to one of your
       objects, then the driver will call it at  object-load-time
       just  as  if  the  driver had inserted the function on its
       own.  Be aware that if you do this and the driver needs to
       add  __INIT  in  order to initialize variables, then there
       will be a conflict.

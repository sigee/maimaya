       Every  object should have a create function defined within
       it.  Within that function, all initial object  initializa-
       tion should be done.  create() is called on *all* objects.
       *NOTE* - This behavior is different than the  stock  3.1.2
       LPmud  driver.  In 3.1.2, if an object is created first by
       being inherited, then create() wasn't called  on  it.   In
       MudOS,  this  behavior  has changed so that it is *always*
       called when an object is created.  As a  result,  you  may
       see  some  odd  behavior  if you have a create in a parent
       object that does a write, you will see two writes,  as  if
       create()  had  been  called  twice on the same object.  In
       reality, create *is* being called twice, but on two  *dif-
       ferent* objects: the parent, and the child that is calling
       parent::create() manually.

       The  driver  calls  epilog()  in  master  after the master
       object has been loaded.  Mudlibs typically use  epilog  to
       initialize  data  structures  in  master (such as security
       tables etc).  epilog() should returns an  array  of  file-
       names which correspond to objects that the mudlib wants to
       have preloaded; that is, loaded before  the  first  player
       logs  in.   For  each  filename returned in the array, the
       driver will called preload(filename) in master.

       The variable 'load_empty' is non-zero if the -e option was
       specified  when starting up the driver.  It can be used as
       a signal to the mudlib to not load castles, etc.

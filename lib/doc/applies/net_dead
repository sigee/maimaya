       net_dead  - called by the MudOS driver when an interactive

       If an interactive object (i.e. the player object) suddenly
       loses  its  connection (i.e. it goes "net dead"), then the
       driver calls this function on  that  object  giving  it  a
       chance  to clean up, notify its environment etc.  Be aware
       that functions that depend on the object being interactive
       will not work as expected.

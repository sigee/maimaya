       If  RECEIVE_SNOOP is defined in options.h, whenever a user
       is snooping another  user,  all  snoop  text  is  sent  to
       receive_snoop()  in his user object.  Inside of this func-
       tion, you can do as you wish  with  the  text.   A  common
       activity would be to receive() it.

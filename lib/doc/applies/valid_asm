       valid_asm  -  controls  whether  or  not a LPC->C compiled
       object can use asm { }

       When the driver is compiled with LPC_TO_C, valid_asm()  is
       called  whenever  the  asm { } structure is found in code.
       If it returns 0, the compilation will  terminate  with  an
       error.

       The asm { } structure is used as follows:

              asm {
                <C code>
              }

       It  causes  the  code  between  the braces to be literally
       inserted into the compiled file.

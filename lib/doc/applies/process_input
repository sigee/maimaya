       send a copy of what the player is  typing  to  the  player
       object.

       If process_input is present in the player object, then the
       MudOS driver parser will send it a copy of each  line  the
       player  types.   Process_input  makes it easy to implement
       features like command history and protection against  wiz-
       cuffs.   process_input  can  also  modify the player input
       before it is parsed.  If process_input returns a  non-zero
       string,  that string is used by the driver instead of what
       the player typed.

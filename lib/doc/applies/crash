       The driver calls crash() in master in the event  that  the
       driver crashes (segmentation fault, bus error, etc).  This
       function offers a way to shutdown the mudlib (safe players
       and  other  important data) before the driver crashes.  It
       also lets you log various useful information such as  what
       signal crashed the driver, what object was active, who the
       current player was etc.

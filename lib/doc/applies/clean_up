       The clean_up() function is called by the driver on a regu-
       lar basis in all objects that have been inactive  for  the
       time specified for clean_up() in the runtime configuration
       file.  One flag is  passed  to  the  function,  specifying
       whether or not the object has been inheritted by anything.
       If clean_up() returns 0, clean_up() will never  be  called
       again  on that object.  If it returns 1, it will be called
       again when the object remains inactive for  the  specified
       clean_up() delay.

       One thing that might be commonly done by an object in this
       function is destructing itself to conserve memory.

       This  function  must  exist  in  the master object.  It is
       called by the domain statistic functions in the driver  to
       determine  what domain a given object should be associated
       with.  This is totally arbitrary  and  up  to  the  mudlib
       designers wishes.  It should be noted that the domain that
       the object is assigned to will receive "credit" for all of
       the objects behavior (errors, heart_beats, worth, etc).

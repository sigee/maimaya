       The driver calls compile_object(3) in the event  that  the
       mudlib  instructs  the driver to load a file that does not
       exist.   For  example,   the   driver   will   call   com-
       pile_object("/obj/file.r")  in  master if the mudlib calls
       call_other("/obj/file.r",       "some_function")        or
       new("/obj/file.r")  and  /obj/file.r.c  names  a file that
       does not exist.  The compile_object() function is expected
       to  return  0  if the mudlib does not wish to associate an
       object with the file name "/obj/file.r".   If  the  mudlib
       does  wish  to  associate  an  object  with  the  filename
       "/obj/file.r", then the mudlib should return the object it
       wishes  associated.   After an association is made between
       an object and a filename, then it will be as if the  file,
       file.r.c,  did  exist (to the driver) and when loaded pro-
       duced the object that compile_object() returned.

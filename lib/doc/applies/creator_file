       creator_file  -  specifies the uid to give to a newly cre-

       The creator_file() function is called in the master object
       each  time a new object is created.  The `filename' of the
       object is passed as the sole  parameter,  and  the  string
       that  creator_file()  returns  is  set as the new object's
       uid.  If the AUTO_SETEUID option is  enabled  at  compile-
       time  of  the  driver,  it is also set as the new object's
       euid.

       One  exception:  if  the  AUTO_TRUST_BACKBONE  option   is
       enabled  at compile-time of the driver, and creator_file()
       returns the backbone uid (as specified by get_bb_uid()  in
       the  master  object), the object is given the uid and euid
       of the object that loaded it.

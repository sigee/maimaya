       When the mudlib moves an object "A" inside another  object
       "B",  the  driver  (the  move_object() efunction) does the
       following:

       1.     if "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init()  in
              "B"

       2.     causes  each  living object in the inventory of "B"
              to call init() in "A".  regardless of  whether  "A"
              is living or not.

       3.     if  "A" is living, causes "A" to call the init() in
              each object in the inventory of "B".

       Note:  an  object  is   considered   to   be   living   if
       enable_commands(3) has been called by that object.

       Typically,  the  init(4)  function in an object is used to
       call  add_action(3)  for  each  command  that  the  object
       offers.

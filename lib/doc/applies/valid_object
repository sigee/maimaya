       After  loading   an   object,   the   driver   will   call
       valid_object()  with the newly created object as its argu-
       ment, in the master object.  If the function  exists,  and
       returns 0, then the object will be destructed and the efun
       that caused it to load will error out.   If  it  does  not
       exist,  or returns 1, then loading will proceed as normal.
       In conjunction with 'nomask' and the inherits() efun, this
       could   allow   safely   restricting   destruct()   via  a
       simul_efun.

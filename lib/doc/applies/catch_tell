       If  INTERACTIVE_CATCH_TELL  is defined in options.h, when-
       ever the driver has something to tell  an  object  due  to
       say(),  shout(),  tell_object(),  etc.   catch_tell in the
       player object will  be  called  with  the  message  to  be
       printed.  The message can be displayed, discarded, or mod-
       ified in any way desired.  This is a useful  way  to  have
       flexible earmuffs, or to support intelligent clients.

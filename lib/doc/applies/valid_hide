       Add valid_hide to master.c in order to  allow  objects  to
       hide  themselves,  or  see  other objects that have hidden
       themselves.  When an object tries to  use  the  set_hide()
       efun  to  hide  itself, valid_hide will be called with the
       object that is wanting to hide as the sole parameter.   It
       should  return  1  to allow it, or 0 to not allow it.  The
       same call takes place when it needs to be determined if  a
       certain object should be able to see hidden objects.

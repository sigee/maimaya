       After  every  reset interval (whose exact length is deter-
       mined on a mud by mud basis, but averages around  every  2
       hours),  reset()  is called in every object that currently
       exists.  If LAZY_RESETS is defined  in  options.h  in  the
       driver,  reset()  will only be called in objects when they
       are touched (near players), so unused objects will not  be
       loaded  from  the swap file to reset.  The reset() call is
       usually used to check if any treasures and/or monsters  in
       the room have been removed so they can be replaced.

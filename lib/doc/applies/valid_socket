       Each  of  the socket efunctions calls valid_socket() prior
       to executing.  If valid_socket returns 0, then the  socket
       efunction  fails.   If  valid_socket  returns  1, then the
       socket efunction attempts to succeed.  The first  argument
       'caller'  is  the object that called the socket efunction.
       The second argument is the name of  the  socket  efunction
       that    is    being   called   (e.g.   socket_write()   or
       socket_bind()).  The third argument is an array of  infor-
       mation.   The first element of the array (when applicable)
       is file descriptor being referenced.  The  second  element
       of  the  array  is  the owner of the socket (object).  The
       third element of the array is the address (string) of  the
       remote end of the socket.  The fourth element of the array
       is the port number associated with the socket.

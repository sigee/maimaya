       This apply is called by destruct() on each of the destruc-
       ted object's contents or  inventory.   In  so  doing,  the
       driver  passes  the flag 1.  This allows objects to choose
       between moving to the destructed object's  environment  or
       be  destructed.  This function should return 0 if the move
       was ok.  The object is destructed if the return  value  is
       non-zero (ie failed to move).

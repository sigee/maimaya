LPC data type: int

One of the simplest LPC data types, it stores whole numbers.
An int is declared with the keyword "int" followed by the variable name.
Example:

int x;

After declaration, like all data types, it has NULL value.  Unlike other
data types, an int with a NULL value may be used.  When an int
that has not be initialized is used, it is used as if its value were 0.

Example assignment:

x = 5;

Nightmare mudlib lfun: query_auto_load()

mixed *query_auto_load();

This function is called by the player object in every object in the possession
of the player when the player quits or saves.  The functions is different
from the LPMud function of the same name in that it returns a mixed array.
This array is generally of the form:
    ({ "path/file_name", ({ var1, var2, ..., varn }) })
Where element 1 of the array is a string representing the file name of the
item to be cloned when the player logs in.  The second element of the array
is another mixed arrays containing any information you want to be saved
and passed into the new object that is created the next time the player
logs in.

Any object which autoloads should have the function remove() defined for it,
so that the player's encumbrance is updated upon its destruction.  If you
are inheriting any standard object in the Nightmare mudlib, this is already done
for you.  Not also another difference from the LPMud mudlib, namely that
autoload objects may be droppable if you desire.

*****
example:

If you choose to save some information stored in an autoload object, like a
counter and a string that keeps the name of a player's spouse, these were, as
you remember from above, stored in the second element of the return array of
query_auto_load(), like:

mixed *query_auto_load() {
    return ({ "/obj/divorcer", ({ count, spouse }) });
}

To bring these values into the object at login, you need
also to define a function called init_arg(mixed *arr);

For the functioning of this, see init_arg() man.

But, if the values of any variables do not matter, then simply use:

mixed *query_auto_load() { return ({ "filename", ({}) }); }

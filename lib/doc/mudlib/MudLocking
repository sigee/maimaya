                        How to Lock Your Mud

While in development, you should lock your mud to all but people
who are there to build.  Too many muds never open because they do not lock
their mud or they allow online people who just play around.  It simply
takes too much concentration to develop a mud to have so many distractions.

The Nightmare Mudlib has mechanisms to let you lock out all but those people
who need to be on the mud  for development.  In addition, when emergencies
arise (like a hard drive crash where players can lose their .o files if
they login), it is set up so you can quickly lock up the mud in order to.
assess damage.

To lock the mud:
Change the #define MUD_IS_LOCKED 0
so that it says #define MUD_IS_LOCKED 1

You want to make sure that the people you want to allow into the mud are
members of groups defined in config.h in:
#define LOCKED_ACCESS_ALLOWED ({})
It should be an array of ok groups.  The mud ships with the arch groups,
superuser and assist, as allowed for locked access.
If you want to allow people other than those defined in groups,
use the command addguest:
<addguest [guest name]>

After setting up the config file, update master.c and login.c
If you add any guests, you have to update in the following order:
banish.c
login.c

You should always have LOCKED_ACCESS_ALLOWED defined so your minimal emergency
team can get on.  This way if an emergency arises, you only
need to do the foolowing steps:

change #define MUD_IS_LOCKED 0
to #define MUD_IS_LOCKED 1

update master.c

Throw everyone off the mud, but you and everyon in
LOCKED_ACCESS_ALLOWED in config.h will be able to get right back on.  You can 
also simply shutdown the mud.

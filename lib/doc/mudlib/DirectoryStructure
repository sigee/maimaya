The directory structure of the Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 is designed to be
as intuitive thinking in order to allow you security along with
supposed to represent a natural way of dividing up the files based on
the style in which the mudlib was coded.

Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 ships with the following sub-directories of the root:
/adm
Secure directory for the mud.
/cmds
Commands available to all users at all times
/d
Domains of the mud.  Areas which link creator realms.
/daemon
Non-secure daemons
/doc 
Documentation and help files
/ftp
You hook up the ftp daemon available at the same site as the mudlib here
/hm
Not currently used.  High mortal castles will be stored here.
/log
Logging is done to this directory
/news
All your news files are located here
/std
Inheritable and backbone objects
/tmp
An open directory to which everyone has write access
/wizards
Personal files of creators where their domains can be found.

As an administrator, you are most conerned with the /adm, /daemon,
/std directories.  Each directory comes with help files describing
what is stores and what sort of access you should be granting to it.
In general, /adm and /cmds/system should be administrator only
directories.  Only arches with an absolute *need* should have write
access to /std.  And only admins and arches should have access to /cmds
The reast should be based on a need to access basis.

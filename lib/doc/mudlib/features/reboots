You can set your mud to reboot at a consistant interval with this mudlib.
Nightmare LPMud runs on a 23 hour reboot cycle.  This is done through
the command "setreboot", where you set the reboot cycle in hours.  The
cycle will stay the same forever unless you use the command again
to change it.  We recommend you do not use cycles which are multiples
of 24, since this will consistently interrupt people from the same
region of the world in their prime playing time.

For example, if you set the reboot to 24 hours at 5 am, people from
Australia would *always* have their mudding itnerrupted by a reboot.

"nextreboot" gives the timne for the next scheduled reboot.

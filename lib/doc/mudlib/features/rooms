Rooms with the Nightmare Mudlib 3.2 are built to maximize functionality with
an easy learning curve for new wizzes.  This is mostly done through the
overloading of room functions so that the same function can be used to
have functions called as can be used to set values.  For example:

set_search("table", (: "search_table :));

Can be used to have the function search_table() in the room object called
whenever a player searches the table.  Similarly,

set_search("table", "You find only dust upon the table.");

Can be used to print a string whenever the player searches the table.  You
therefore have the dual functionality of having simple string values or
creating functions to be called, yet from the point of view of the newbie
creator, they only have to remember one function for handling searching.

This sort of behaviour can be found throughout the mudlib, but is most
complete in the room objects.

For detailed information on what is involved in room coding and what
features exist, see the documentation on room building.

Output from rooms is based upong output content and sensory type.  Room
descriptions are divided up into the following parts:

Verbose description
scents
sounds
exits
living objects
inanimate objects

This output is physically separated on the screen by spacing.  For those
with terminal types using the mudlib's supported set of colour codes, this
information is also coloured so that the data can be sorted easily by
the mind.

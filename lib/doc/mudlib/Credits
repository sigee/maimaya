Mudlib history:
The Nightmare Mudlib was developed using the MudOS 0.8.11 driver and the
accompanying mudlib (often referred to as TMI-1 or TMI 0.8.11, no relation
however to TMI-2).

Version 1.* still retained the basic TMI 0.8.11 structure, with the most
notable differences being the creation of a working limb oriented combat
system, many extra inheritables, and some spiffy features.

Version 2.* marked the point at which the Nightmare Mudlib was no longer
"an enhanced TMI 0.8.11 mudlib".  The entire living object was new, as
was much of the simul_efun object, most commands, and the login object.
Over the course of 2.* development, socket handling (which had been
borrowed from the Basis Mudlib during 1.* development) actually took
on characteristics which look more like the old Nightmare tcp network.
A major trend during the course of 2.* devlopment was a dramatic increase
is mudlib effeciency.  Still remaining in the mudlib from TMI 0.8.11 was
the master object, the security system, some simul_efuns, the user shell,
and the basic object and container.

Version 3.* marks a near complete rewrite of the basic mudlib.  A new
system for races, a brand new security system for 3.0, then again for
version 3.3, languages, faster code, tighter integration with the driver,
a new user interface that gets rid of the old one that has hung around
mudlibs since the early days of LPMud, a complete rewrite of room.c, a
new mailing system, a udp network for communicating with CDlib muds, a
more modular header library including a more consistent use of headers.
Still stuck in tact from TMI 0.8.11 are a few simul_efuns and obscure
commands. 

Version 3.2 introduced an entirely new directory.  In addition it is
the first release in which the number of SimulEfuns is drastically less
than the preceeding release.  This is largely an effeciency release.
It is marked by a *huge* leap in the efficiency of the mudlib code, as
well as a much more intuitive mudlib structure.  In addition to reducing
redundant and useless SimulEfuns, we have also cut down on the number
of daemons in the mudlib.  No new daemons have root access.  Many old
ones have lost root access and now exist in the directory /daemon.  And
a lot of old daemons have been thrown out the window.

Version 3.3 is a tremendous departure from the old mudlib.  Nightmare
has dropped UID security in favour of a stack based security using
object priveledges.  This new security system owes A LOT to ideas
given to me through conversation with Ellery and Zellski.  In
addition, Beek and Rust put their 2 cents in, often which I took.  The
new security system is matched up with a new directory structure which
reflects how it works.  New features include player law and disease.
 
Future development:
Nightmare IV really should be this version, except I wish to finish
the new combat system before releasing Nightmare IV.  I expect
Nightmare IV to be released concurrently to MudOS v21.

The plans for Nightmare V have already been laid.  The inheritance
structure will be completely reworked to make it completely object
oriented.  This will be the result of a planned merger with the
ZorkMUD mudlib, giving the mudlib much better command parsing
capability and adding features which will make it more versatile as a
mudlib to use in puzzle and quest oriented games.

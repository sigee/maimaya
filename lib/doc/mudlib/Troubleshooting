Troubleshooting:
If, for some reason the mud is not running as described at any point
in the process shown in these file, your number 1 priority should
look at your compilation of the driver, namely the options.h file.
The Nightmare Mudlib is developed on a working and heavily played
mud.  What you get has in fact been running using the MudOS driver, so
unless we made an idiotic blunder in tarring up the mudlib (which we would
catch really soon (I hope)), something is simply going wrong with the
way the driver is running the mudlib.

Problem #1: What version of MudOS are you using?
Nightmare writes its mudlib releases for full MudOS driver releases.
This means that there might be compatibility problems between the mudlib
and half-releases (A full release is one with 3 numbers like 0.9.19,
a half-release is one with 4 numbers, like 0.9.19.5).  Nightmare 2.4
was for 0.9.16.  Nightmare 2.5 was for 0.9.17.  There was no
release for the 20 something half releases in between.  The solution
is either to figure out the compat busters on your own, or grab the
latest full release.  Nightmare always updates releases for full
MudOS releases, so you can be sure the mudlib works with the latest full 
MudOS release.
Also, if you are using an old version of MudOS, there might be some compat
problems.

Problem #2: The driver options.h file
Check to see that you have set the appropriate definitions in here.

If none of those are the case, contact Descartes@Nightmare.  Mail

with any problems regarding the installation of your Nightmare Mudlib.

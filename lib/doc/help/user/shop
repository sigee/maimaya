The following is a list of shop commands:

<help shop> 
gives you this screen

<cost>
<cost item_name> will tell you how much the vendor wants of the first item
	  	 named item_name
<cost item_name #> if there are more than one items named item_name, this
		   will give you the cost of the #th item called item_name
		   ex: <cost torch 2> will give you the cost of the 2nd torch

<value>
<value item_name> will tell you how much the vendor is willing to pay
		  for the first item called item_name you have.
<value item_name #> will tell you how much the vendor is willing to pay
		    for the #th item called item_name you have.
		    ex: <value sword 4> will give you the amount the
			vendor is willing to pay for your 4th sword.

<buy>
<buy item_name> will have you purchase the first item listed called 
		item_name if you have enough money in the right currency.
<buy item_name #> will have you purchase the #th item listed called
		  item_name.
		  ex: <buy shield 2> will have you purchase the second
			shield listed

<sell>
<sell item_name> will have you sell the first item in your inventory with the
		 name item_name
<sell item_name #> will have you sell the #th item named item_name in your
		   inventory
		   ex: <sell helm 3> will have you sell the third shield
<sell all> will have you sell all items on you

<show>
<show item_name> will have the vendor give you a closer look at the first item
		 in the store called item_name
<show item_name #> will have the vendor give you a closer look at the #th item
		   in the store called item_name

<list>
<list> gives you a listing of all items for sale in the shop, as well as their
       fair price.  This is not necessarily the price the vendor will charge.
<list weapons> will list all items which are weapons
<list armours> will list all items which are armours
<list other> will list all non-weapon and non-armour items for sale
<list type> will list all weapons or armours of type type
            ex: <list blade> will list all weapons of type blade for sale
		<list shield> will list all armours of type shield for sale
<list item_name> will list all items with the name item_name
		 ex: <list sword> will list all items in the store that respond
		     to the name "sword".  Thus if you notice the fourth item
		     on the list is the sword you want, <buy sword 4> will get
		     it for you.  Be aware though that another person selling
		     at the same time you are checking this could make it the 
		     fifth sword.

Cleric
Clerics are very diverse in the specifics of their beliefs, but they are
united in a general belief in the oneness of everything.  That general
belief may manifest itself through polytheism or the deification of nature.
They are good people who teach against the use of destructive powers
whether they be spiritual or physical.  They get their powers from
nature, powers of healing and of faith.  They do not have much time to
learn, nor do they much care for, the skills of fighting.  They enjoy
spending time on quests of good which reward them with the experience to
grow, instead of pursuing their time gaining experience in killing. 
Races with high intelligence and wisdom make the best clerics.  It is also
recommended that they have a decent constitution.

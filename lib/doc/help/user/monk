Monk
Monks are a group of people who believe in a single good deity, and they
believe in the concept of holy war in the name of that deity against the
evil of the world.  Their historical counterparts are the Knights Templar
of Christian Jerusalem, but these Nightmare counterparts are not Christian,
merely monotheistic.  In pursuit of their goal of ridding existence of Evil,
they spend time mastering the skills of hand-to-hand combat, as well as the
use of projectile weapons.  In addition, their deity grants them powers through
their faith which can be used also for their defense.  The best monk, is a
person of a race with great intelligence, wisdom, and strength.

Mage
Mages are people who have devoted their lives to learning magic for the same
reasons that motivate most people on a day-to-day basis, material gain and
the pure "fun" of the use of magic.  They therefore have no powers of faith,
and their time spent learning magic takes away from any time they might 
spend learning fighting skills.  They are very capable of learning,
however, offensive type spells and spells of a conjuring nature.  They are
generally not tremendously pious nor are they terribly wicked.  They must, however, be fairly intelligent.

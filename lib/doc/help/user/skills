Nightmare has implemented a new system of skills to compliment the old
system of stats.  This new system follows from the concept that their
are certian unchanging facts about and individual that come from their
racial heritage.  These are the stats so familiar to muds.  You may roll
stats 3 times, but you still face the same penalties on each roll based
on the race you have chosen.
Skills are studied and mastered.  Depending on the class you choose, you will
spend your time studying individual skills to become as good at your class
as one may become.  Unfortunately, no class is able to master all skills.
You master skills by gaining experience and studying the skills.

skills divide into 4 categories:
combat           weapons           deception        magic

On Nightmare, the class represents the way of life you will choose for your
Nightmare is a world that simulates a reality of ancient fantasy.  In
pursuit of the goal of making this reality come as alive as possible through
a textual medium, we have created a system of classes which represent
the life generalized life-calling of individuals.  
In general, people fell into one of the folowing groups in the fantasy world
envisioned here:  Fighters- warriors, knights, squires, soldiers, and other
fighting types who spent their lives waging war through weapons and hand-to-handcombat.  Monks- Men and women who believed in divinity and in the righteousness
of holy war.  Mages- People who devoted their lives to learning magic for the
sake of conjuring and fighting in pursuits of material glory.  Clerics- People
who spent their lives learning the magic of the healing arts and self defense
for the sake of a greater good.  Rogues- Vile people who made their living off
and selling of goods.  Kataans- which were but now are not, are now people
who followed evil and the knowledge of some magic and some combat.
Of these types of people, Nightmare has 5 classes.  These classes may also
specialize by joining guilds.  The classes are as follows:
Fighter
Monk
Mage
Cleric
Rogue
Kataan

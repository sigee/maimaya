There are two post offices in the standard domain of Nightmare, the Praxis
post office and the Outlands post office.  Nightmare is connected the
intermud system, which means you can send mail from Nightmare to the other
muds on the system.  The syntax is mail player@mudname.
To find out which muds are on the intermud system, type <muds>.

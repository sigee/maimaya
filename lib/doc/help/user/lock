Syntax: <lock terminal>

A command to lock up your terminal in case you
step away from it for a moment.  This only protects
your mud character from having commands entered on it.
People can still use your computer at the host level.
In other words, if you use "lock terminal", Nightmare will ask
you for your Nightmare password.  No one can use your character on the mud
until you enter that password.  However, people can still access the
terminal you are on (i.e. where you are telnetting from).

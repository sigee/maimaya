Genetic traits:
Hobbits, though not particularly pleasing, are an enjoyable site to look
at as they masterfully move about here and there, for they are unusually
dexterous and highly charismatic.  Their modest wit makes for humorous
(though somewhat embarrassing for them) situations.  Although not terribly
weak or susceptible to being harmed, they are indeed neither tanks nor
beasts of burden.

Physical description:
They are short, jovial creatures with a tendency to enjoy
more booze and food than their tiny bodies can handle.  But
in spite of their overeating, and overdrinking, they
always have their wits about them and can outmanoeuver the best.
Although they tend towards roguish practices, it is rarely out of malice,
and mostly shows itself in minor thievery in adventure.
Humans describe the little hair they have on their head as "balding".  It often
comes in red or auburn, and their skin is very pale.

Most common occupation: Rogue

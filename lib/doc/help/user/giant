Genetic traits:
Giants are without question the strongest sentients ever to exist.
They are capable of taking hits which would kill other beings, but they rank
down with the orcs in intelligence.  As with most creatures of such great size,
however, they are not too great at moving around.  They
are found mostly unappealing by people of most other races.

Physical description:
Giants stand approximately 4-5 meters tall.  Although they are much like
humans in appearance, their great size distorts their features in
a grotesque sort of way.  Their skin and hair colours vary as greatly
as those of humans.

Most common occupation: Fighter

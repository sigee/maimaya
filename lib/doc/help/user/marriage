The institution of marriage exists here on Nightmare.
Marriages are performed by high mortal monks in the Praxis Chapel
north of the monastary.  The content of the ceremony depends on the
monk who is performing it.  In order to get married, you should find
a high mortal monk and ask that person what type of ceremony he/she performs.
Then you should decide on the high mortal whom you prefer to perform your
ceremony, and arrange a time and date.  For a big ceremony, mail arch to
get the announcement posted in the mud news.  And feel free to
post on the main board.

Nightmare is best experienced from a colour terminal.  Information
comes across to people with special codes denoting what type of information
is being sent.  If you have used the "setenv" command to specify
a terminal protocol that supports colour codes, then the informations
will be colour coded.  Otherwise it will come across in the regular black
and white (or green and black or green and orange).

You may send out text in colour to others in your "say" and "tell", etc
without fear of sending bad codes to people who cannot understand them
using the protocol developed by Pinkfish@Discworld.  Keywords must be
enclosed in %^ %^.  The keywords are
RED     BLUE     ORANGE     YELLOW     GREEN     BLACK     WHITE     CYAN
MAGENTA B_RED    B_BLUE     B_ORANGE   B_YELLOW  B_GREEN   B_MAGENTA B_BLACK
B_WHITE B_CYAN   FLASH      BOLD       INITTERM  RESET     WINDOW    ENDTERM

Example:
This is %^RED%^red.

would have "red." appear in red
Terminals are automatically reset at the end of a line.
To reset before the end of a line, use the code RESET.

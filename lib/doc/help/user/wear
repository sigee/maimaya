Syntax: <wear [item]> or <wear [item] on [limb]>

This allows you to wear an armour item so that it protects you in combat.
Note that some items may have extra magic protections which need to be
activated by calling the magic through a magic word.  The armour is 
automatically equipped to the body parts for which it is meant, if no armour
of the same type is already worn there.

Some armours can be worn on more than one limb (mostly rings).  To wear
these on specific limbs, you must specify which limb.

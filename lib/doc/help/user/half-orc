Genetic traits:
Half-orcs are perhaps a bit more "human" than orcs.  In fact, it is
believed they might have human blood in them leading to their greater
intellectual abilities, mobility, and looks over orcs.  In addition,
it is also believed that this is why they are neither as strong or as sturdy.

Physical description:
Although hairy by human standards, they do not have the cousin It look
of orcs.  Instead, their hair covers their bodies much in the same way
that gorillas' bodies are covered.  They stand only 2 meters in height,
and are extremeley thin and thus more agile than orcs.  Their skin
is a dark red-brown to match their hair.  They also have small, reddish-
yellow beaks.

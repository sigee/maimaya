Rogue
These people live on the misery of others, whether it is directly through
the killing of people in a random sort of way, or through stealing and
picking others.  These people often become assassins and thieves, and they
get their experience in any way they see fit.  They are not the best of fighters nor do they have time to learn the magical arts.  But they are very adept
at the arts of deception.  Races with high dexterity make the best rogues.

Rogues have the following special abilities:
steal, pick, lockpick, backstab, stealth, cloak, sneak, peek, hide

Fighter
These people form a very diverse group whose only common theme is that they
have devoted their lives to learning the skills of combat.  People of this
class may be good evil or neutral, they may serve a pious king, or they 
may serve only themselves.  But they generally should have high strength
and constitution to aid them in their physical battles.  They spend much
of their learning time studying how to use weapons of different types, as
well as mastering hand-to-hand combat and self-defense.

Fighters also have the ability to discern among different weapon types.
Fighters get a bonus when they parry.

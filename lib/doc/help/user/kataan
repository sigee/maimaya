Kataan
Evil people who serve demons and devils on this earth.  They have a
base knowledge of some magic and are great with projectile weapons.

well as those, nor do they fight nearly as well as fighters.
Kataans should have high intelligence, strength, and charisma.

Kataans also use the following abilities:
stealth, sneak, hide, backstab, peek

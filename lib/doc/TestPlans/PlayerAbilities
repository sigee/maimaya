		Test Plan for Player Ability Commands

This test plan is designed to help ensure that all commands being
placed into the Nightmare Mudlib uphold a minimum, consistent quality
level.  Before a command may be submitted to approval for approval, it
must pass each step of this test.  Note that under no circumstances
should the person issuing the command EVER see an error.

Description:
The Player Ability Commands Test Plan tests the quality of newly
created commands for special player abilites.  Unique to player
ability commands are balance requirements, most of which cannot be
tested through a generic test.  Therefore it is important to be
familiar with balance requirements before writing a command, and check
yourself that they meet those requirements before submitting commands
to approval.

notify_fail() functions should never pass syntax information to a
player like creator commands do.  For example, a read command should
do notify_fail("Read what?\n"), NOT 
notify_fail("Syntax: <read [post number]>\n");

*****************************************************************

1. Command line arguments
a. Execute the command without any arguments.
Expected outcome: If the command requires arguments,
	then the command should do notify_fail() and
	return 0.  The player should thus see that
	notify_fail() message unless another command
	by that name is executed afterwards.
	If the command does not require arguments, the
	command executes correctly for a no arguments
	situation.
b. Execute the command with arguments of an improper type.

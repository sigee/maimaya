This is a list of suggestions that I have put together. They are
things that should go into an area, some of it to make the area more
realistic,others to make it more interesting and fun to explore.

** Any monsters that would normally have a weakness to a certain
type of spell, should have it set in the monster code. For example I have
a frost giant in my High Mortal area. I have set his strength to cold spells
and his weakness to fire. So he has

 	set_property( "strength", "cold");
		and
	set_property( "weakness", "fire");

Please use this set_property because it is directly related to magic
users spells, and makes the game more realistic.

** On any worthless treasure you have in the game (i.e. stuff no
one would ever buy back) please consider using the set_destroy();
option in the object's code.

** For any powerful weapon, or even vaguely powerful weapon, please
set a decay rate on it, depending on the wc of the weapon and how
difficult it was to obtain. But it should have some decay rate.
Balance will check it to make sure it is appropriate.

** Something to consider doing is adding special attacks for your
monsters. It is very easy to do and makes the game much more
interesting. If you want/need an example of a room/monster with
a special attack please mail either myself or Bohemund, who also
has several examples.
 
** If you can, please include ANSI in your areas. It looks neat
and the players love it. Ansi in code is done the same way as when you
speak.

	set_short( "%^RED%^a red gummy bear%^RESET%^");

Please use the RESET after you are through, or else it will make a
player's entire inventory that color.

** Think about using pre and post exit functions. They
make an area more fun to explore.

** All shop keepers must have a bargaining between 125-175. 

** All stores from now on must have a specific type specified.

** If it fits the theme of your area, please put some sort of
fishing area in. Although it is true that we do not want people
to be able to fish in every area we have in order to heal, at
the moment there are only about 3 areas with fishing places,
so we could do with several more. But, please, only do it
if it fits the idea of your area.

** All set_shorts for weapons, armour, and rooms should be lower
case except for proper nouns! Areas will not go into the game anymore
unless they are lower case, in an effort to make the mud look more
unified.

** Try to add an element of randomness to your area. The mud has been
a very stagnent place up until recently. We have decided to make the
mud much more random, and more interactive. Hence the conception
of monsters like the Gremlin. It is not to difficult to make your
monsters have random amounts of hp, money etc. So please, consider
doing this.

** Make monsters more interactive with players. This would include
giving monsters the ability to steal, talk back to people (try telling
the gremlin something some time). It is also possible to make monsters
shout stuff, etc. Mail Bohemund for examples. He is the king of
interactive monsters. Also think about giving your NPC's the
ability to heal themselves. It is very easy to do. Merely set
a spell chance, and then when you set the spells s/he has give
her/him the spell mend me or heal me, etc.

** Use emotes and achats! They can make monsters fun and more
interesting.

	set_emote(10, ({ "Descartes is a weenie" }),0);
			or
	set_emote(10, ({ "Bohemund is a bigger weenie" }),1);

** On all upper level monsters (15+) please use the max damage.
Otherwise players are severing limbs much to quickly. So it would say:

	set_max_dam( "torso", 2500);

** Rather than having many different lines to set properties in rooms,
it is now possible to combine all of them. So, originally code looked
like this:

	set_property( "indoors",1 );
	set_property( "light", 1);

Now, you should change your code so that it reads like this:

	set_properties( [( "light" :1, "indoors" :1 ]) );

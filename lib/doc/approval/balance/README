        Something important to remember is that muds are a constantly
changing place. Therefore, it often becomes necessary for balance
numbers to be changed, or the standards of code. Once your area has
been opened by approval, you, as the wizard are expected to keep it
maintained and within the legal boundaries set by the approval team.
If an area is not in balance, the wizard will be notified, and he/she
has two weeks to make the proper changes. If a wizard is unavailable 
or unable to fix their area, it will be done for them by approval.
         The approval team retains the right to change any code they
see fit, as long as it is in agreement with the balance/qc docs.
All immortals will be notified through mail of the changes that were
made to their area.

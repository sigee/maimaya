NOVICE AREAS:

Should be easily accessible, not too far from the mud entrance.  I support the
idea of having signposts for novice areas, but not higher level areas.

Novice areas should provide a variety of monsters of various levels, some
limited equipment, (No RARE!! items, etc.) some limited weapons and minor
treasures.  There should be PUBS and SHOPS within novice areas.

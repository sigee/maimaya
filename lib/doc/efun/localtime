       localtime()  converts a time value (as returned by time())
       into an array of values which represents the time locally.
       In  the past time() was used to get the time in GMT (UTC),
       and then local definitions  were  used  to  determine  the
       local  offset  from  GMT.   This roundabout approach is no
       longer necessary.  localtime() returns the  seconds,  min-
       utes  and hours, the day, month and year, day of the week,
       day of the year, the name of the local  timezone  and  how
       far  the  MUD  is from GMT.  This information is retrieved
       directly from the operating system and made  available  to
       the  driver  without the use of MUD-specific configuration
       files.

       localtime() returns an array containing the values  speci-
       fied  above.  The index for each value is defined symboli-
       cally in localtime.h.  The following table summarizes  the
       array returned by localtime().

            int  LT_SEC         Seconds after the minute (0..59)
            int  LT_MIN         Minutes after the hour (0..59)
            int  LT_HOUR        Hour since midnight (0..23)
            int  LT_MDAY        Day of the month (1..31)
            int  LT_MON         Months since January (0..11)
            int  LT_YEAR        Year (guarenteed to be >= 1900)
            int  LT_WDAY        Days since Sunday (0..6)
            int  LT_YDAY        Days since January 1 (0..365)
            int  LT_GMTOFF Seconds after GMT (UTC)
            string    LT_ZONE        Timezone name

       exec()  -  switches a player (interactive) connection from
       one object to another

       This efunction allows the  interactive  link  to  a  given
       object to be migrated to another object.  That is, after a
       successful  exec(to,  from)  call,  interactive(to)   will
       return  1 and interactive(from) will return 0.  The player
       that was controlling 'from' will  begin  controlling  'to'
       following  the  exec() call.  Note that this is a powerful
       function and its use must be restricted  if  you  wish  to
       attempt  to have a secure mud.  The proper way to restrict
       the use of exec() is to make a simul_efun of the same name
       and  then  use  valid_override(4) to restrict the use of a
       simul_efun override (i.e. efun::exec()).  The exec() func-
       tion  returns  1 if the switch is successful (and 0 other-
       wise).

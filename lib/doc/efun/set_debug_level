       This efun is only available when the  driver  is  compiled
       with  -DDEBUG_MACRO.  The purpose of this efun is to allow
       the amount and type of debugging information  produced  to
       be  controlled  from  within  the mud (while the driver is
       running).

       For more information,  read  the  file  debug.h  which  is
       included with the driver source.

       If `src' is a string (filename), then the filename will be
       read,  starting  at  byte  # `start', for `len' bytes, and
       returned as a buffer.  If neither argument is  given,  the
       entire file is read.

       If  `src'  is  a buffer, then characters are read from the
       buffer beginning at byte # `start' in the buffer, and  for
       `len' # of bytes, and returned as a string.

       Note  that the maximum number of bytes you can read from a
       file and into a buffer is controlled via the 'maximum byte
       transfer' parameter in the runtime config file.

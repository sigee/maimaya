       Return  the object representing the player that caused the
       calling function to be called.   Note  that  this_player()
       may  return a different value than this_object() even when
       called from within a player  object.   If  this_player  is
       called  as  this_player(1) then the returned value will be
       the interactive that caused the  calling  function  to  be
       called.   this_player(1) may return a different value than
       this_player() in certain cases (such as when command()  is
       used  by  an  admin to force a player to perform some com-
       mand).

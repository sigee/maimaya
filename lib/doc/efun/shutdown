       This  function shuts down the driver in a controlled fash-
       ion (as opposed to how a crash would shut it  down).   The
       'how'  argument  specifes  what  integer value that driver
       should pass to exit().  The convention is to pass 'how' as
       -1  when the script that restarts the driver should die as
       well.  Thus a reboot command would use shutdown() while  a
       halt  command  would  use  shutdown(-1).   The script must
       explicitly check the return value to see if it  is  -1  if
       you wish to use this convention.  Obviously, shutdown() is
       a sensitive function  and  should  be  secured.   As  with
       exec(),  the  way to make it secure is to add a simul_efun
       of the same  name  which  does  the  appropriate  security
       checks.  Be sure to set valid_override(4) up (in master.c)
       to protect against efun::shutdown().

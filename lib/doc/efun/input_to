       input_to()  -  causes  next  line of input to be sent to a
       specified function

       Enable next line of user input to be  sent  to  the  local
       function  `fun' as an argument. The input line will not be
       parsed by the driver.

       Note that input_to is non-blocking which  means  that  the
       object  calling input_to does not pause waiting for input.
       Instead the object continues  to  execute  any  statements
       following the input_to.  The specified function `fun' will
       not be called until the user input has been collected.

       If "input_to()" is called more than once in the same  exe-
       cution, only the first call has any effect.

       If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line given by
       the player will not be echoed, and is not seen if  snooped
       (this is useful for collecting passwords).

       The  function  `fun' will be called with the user input as
       its first argument (a string).  Any  additional  arguments
       supplied  to  input_to will be passed on to `fun' as argu-
       ments following the user input.

       read_bytes()  -  reads a contiguous series of bytes from a
       file into a string

       This function reads 'length' bytes  beginning  at  byte  #
       'start'  in the file named 'path'.  The bytes are returned
       as a string.  Note that (start + length) must not be  past
       the  end of the file or else read_bytes will fail.  If the
       second and third arguments are omitted, the entire file is
       returned.

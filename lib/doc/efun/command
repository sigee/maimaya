       command() - execute a command as if given by the object

       int command( string str, object ob );

       Execute `str' for object `ob', or this_object() if `ob' is
       omitted.  Note that the usability of the  second  argument
       is  determined by the local administrator and will usually
       not be available, in which case an error will result.   In
       case  of failure, 0 is returned, otherwise a numeric value
       is returned, which is the LPC  "evaluation  cost"  of  the
       command.   Bigger  numbers mean higher cost, but the whole
       scale is subjective and unreliable.

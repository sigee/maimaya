       file_name()  returns  the name of the file from which <ob>
       was loaded.  If  the  object  is  a  cloned  object,  then
       file_name()  will  not be an actual file on disk, but will
       be the name of the file from which the object  was  origi-
       nally  cloned,  appended  with  an  octothorpe (#) and the
       object instance number.  Object instance numbers start  at
       0  when  the  game is booted, and increase by one for each
       object cloned, hence the number is unique for each  cloned
       object.   <ob> defaults to this_object() if not specified.

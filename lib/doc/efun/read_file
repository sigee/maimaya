       Read a line of text from a file into a string.  The second
       and third arguments are optional.  If only the first argu-
       ment  is  specified,  the  entire  file  is returned (as a
       string).

       The start_line is the line number of the line you wish  to
       read.   This routine will return 0 if you try to read past
       the end of the file, or if you try to read from a nonposi-
       tive line.

       Every  object  has  both an author and a domain associated
       with it  for  the  purposes  of  tracking  statistics  for
       authors  and domains.  Domains may only be set in the mas-
       ter object function domain_file(4),  however  authors  are
       different.   They can be initialized to some default value
       by author_file(4) in the master object, but  can  also  be
       changed using the set_author efun.

       set_author  changes  the  author  of the object that it is
       called within.  That author will get credit for all future
       actions  of  that  object  that  affect mudlib statistics.
       Note that this may cause some weird numbers  to  occur  in
       the  categories  "objects"  and  "array_size",  since  the
       object may have initialized arrays or been  created  under
       the  original  author's credit, but it could be destructed
       or free the arrays that it's using under  another  author,
       thus  reducing numbers from a count that didn't have those
       same numbers added previously.  To rememdy this, only  use
       set_author  within create(4), and use it before any arrays
       are allocated if at all possible.

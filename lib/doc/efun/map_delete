       map_delete()  -  remove a (key, value) pair from a mapping
       based on the key

       void map_delete( mapping m, mixed element );

       map_delete removes the (key, value)  from  the  mapping  m
       that has key equal to element.

       For example, given:

              mapping names;

              names = ([]);
              names["truilkan"] = "john";
              names["wayfarer"] = "erik";
              names["jacques"] = "dwayne";

       Then:

              map_delete(names,"truilkan");

       causes the mapping 'names' to be equal to:

              (["wayfarer" : "erik", "jacques" : "dwayne"])

       keys(names)    will    not    contain   "truilkan"   after
       map_delete(names,"truilkan")  is  called  [unless   ("tru-
       ilkan", *) is subsequently added back to the mapping].

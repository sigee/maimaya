       add_action() - bind a command verb to a local function

       Set up a local function <fun> to be called when user input
       matches the command <cmd>. Functions called  by  a  player
       command  will  get the arguments as a string. It must then
       return 0 if it was the wrong command, otherwise 1.

       If it was the wrong  command,  the  parser  will  continue
       searching  for  another command, until one returns true or
       give error message to player.

       If the second argument (<cmd>) is not given,  it  must  be
       given by add_verb().  Support of add_verb() is of histori-
       cal reasons.

       Usually add_action() is called only from  an  init()  rou-
       tine.  The object that defines commands must be present to
       the player, either being the player, being carried by  the
       player,  being  the  room  around  the player, or being an
       object in the same room as the player.

       If argument <flag> is 1, then only the leading  characters
       of  the command has to match the verb <cmd> and the entire
       verb is returned by query_verb().  If argument  <flag>  is
       2, then again, only the leading characters must match, but
       query_verb() will only  return  the  characters  following
       <cmd>.

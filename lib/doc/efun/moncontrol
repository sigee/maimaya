       If passed 1, moncontrol() enables profiling.  If passed 0,
       moncontrol() disables profiling.  It can  be  called  many
       times  during  execution,  typical  use is to profile only
       certain parts of driver execution.   moncontrol()  has  no
       effect if profiling is not enabled at driver compile time.

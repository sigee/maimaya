       Store `str' as the error message to be returned instead of
       the default message `What?'.  The  message  will  be  dis-
       played  if  a  0  is  returned  from  an  action setup via
       add_action().  This is the preferred way to display  error
       messages since it allows other objects a chance to respond
       to the same verb (command).  Do not use write() to display
       the  error message since this will require you to return a
       1 (unless you want to see the result  of  the  write()  in
       addition  to  the  'What?'  message).   However, if you do
       return a 1, then no other objects will  get  a  chance  to
       respond to the user command.

       If "notify_fail()" is called more than once, only the last
       call will have an effect.

       The idea behind this function is  to  allow  better  error
       messages than `What?'.

       notify_fail() always returns 0.

       This efunction returns an array of objects that have  been
       cloned  from  the  file  named  by  'name', as well as the
       object 'name' itself, if loaded.  An example use of  chil-
       dren()  is  to find all objects that have been cloned from
       the user object:

              object *list;

              list = children("/obj/user");

       This lets you find all users (both netdead and interactive
       whereas users() only reports interactive users).

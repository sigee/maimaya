       When  reload_object()  is  called on `ob', all the driver-
       maintained  properties  are  re-initialized   (heart_beat,
       call_outs,  light,  shadows,  etc),  all variables are re-
       initialized, and create() is called.   It  has  a  similar
       effect  to  destructing/reloading  the object, however, no
       disk access or parsing is performed.

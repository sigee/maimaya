       This  is a funny function. It will start a local editor on
       an optional file.  This editor is almost UNIX ed  compati-
       ble.  When in the editor type 'h' for help.

       The  <write_fn>  function allows the mudlib to handle file
       locks and administrative logging of files modified.   When
       the  editor writes to a file, the driver will callback the
       <write_fn> function twice.  The first time,  the  function
       is  called  before the write takes place -- <flag> will be
       0.  If the function returns TRUE, the write will continue,
       otherwise it will abort.  The second time, the function is
       called after the write has completed  --  <flag>  will  be
       non-zero.  This callback function should have the form:

              int write_fn(string fname, int flag)

       When  the  editor  is exited, the driver will callback the
       <exit_fn> function.  This function allows  the  mudlib  to
       clean up.  This callback function has the form:

              void exit_fn()

       The  optional  <restricted> flag limits the editor's capa-
       bilities, such as inserting a file, and  saving  using  an
       alternate file name.

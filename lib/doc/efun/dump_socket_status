       dump_socket_status() is a diagnostic facility  which  dis-
       plays  the  current  status  of all LPC sockets configured
       into the MudOS driver.  It is  useful  for  debugging  LPC
       sockets  applications.  Each row in the output corresponds
       to a single LPC socket.  The first row corresponds to  LPC
       socket  descriptor  0,  the second row, 1, etc.  The total
       number of sockets is configured when the driver is  built.

       The  first  column  "Fd"  is  the  operating  system  file
       descriptor associated with the LPC socket.  "State" is the
       current  operational  state  of the LPC socket.  "Mode" is
       the socket  mode,  which  is  passed  as  an  argument  to
       socket_create().   The  local and remote addresses are the
       Internet address and port numbers in  Internet  dot  nota-
       tions.   '*' indicates an address or which is 0.  N.B. LPC
       sockets that are in the CLOSED state are not currently  in
       use;  therefore  the data displayed for that socket may be
       idiosyncratic.

       The following output was generated on Portals,  where  the
       only socket application running at the time was MWHOD.  It
       indicates that two sockets are current in use, one is lis-
       tening  for  connection  requests on a STREAM mode socket.
       The other is waiting for incoming data on a DATAGRAM  mode
       socket.

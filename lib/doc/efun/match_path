       match_path()  searches  a mapping for a path.  Each key is
       assumed to be a string.  The  value  is  completely  arbi-
       trary.   The  efun  finds the largest matching path in the
       mapping.  Keys ended in '/' are  assumed  to  match  paths
       with  character  that follow the '/', i.e. / is a wildcard
       for anything below this directory.

       Passing `flag' as 0  disables  the  object's  heart  beat.
       Passing a `flag' of 1 will cause heart_beat() to be called
       in the object once each  heart  beat  (a  variable  number
       defined  by  your local administrator, usually 2 seconds).
       Passing a `flag' of greater than 1 will  usually  set  the
       number  of  heart  beats  inbetween calls to heart_beat(),
       however your local administrator may have the system  con-
       figured to treat any `flag' above 1 as 1.

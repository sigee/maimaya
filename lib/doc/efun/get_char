       get_char  - causes next character of input to be sent to a
       specified function

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       varargs void get_char( string fun, int flag, ... );

       Enable next character of user input  to  be  sent  to  the
       local  function  `fun' as an argument. The input character
       will not be parsed by the driver.

       Note that get_char is non-blocking which  means  that  the
       object  calling get_char does not pause waiting for input.
       Instead the object continues  to  execute  any  statements
       following the get_char.  The specified function `fun' will
       not be called until the user input has been collected.

       If "get_char()" is called more than once in the same  exe-
       cution, only the first call has any effect.

       If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the char given by
       the player will not be echoed, and is not seen if  snooped
       (this is useful for collecting passwords).

       The  function  `fun' will be called with the user input as
       its first argument (a string).  Any  additional  arguments
       supplied  to  get_char will be passed on to `fun' as argu-
       ments following the user input.

BBUUGGSS
       Please note that get_char has a significant bug  in  MudOS
       0.9 and earlier.  On many systems with poor telnet negoti-
       ation (read: almost every major workstation  on  the  mar-
       ket),  get_char  makes screen output behave strangely.  It
       is not recommended for common usage throughout the  mudlib
       until  that  bug is fixed.  (It is currently only known to
       work well for users connecting from NeXT computers.)

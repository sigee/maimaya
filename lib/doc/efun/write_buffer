       buffer from a source

       If `dest' is a file, then `source' must  be  an  int  (and
       will  be  written  to  the  file in network-byte-order), a
       buffer, or a string, and `source' will be written  to  the
       file `dest' starting at byte # `start'.

       If  `dest' is a buffer, then `source' will be written into
       the buffer starting at byte # `start' in the  buffer.   If
       `source'  is  an  int, it will be written in network-byte-
       order.

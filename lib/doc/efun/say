       Sends a message to the environment of the originator,  all
       items in the same environment, and all items inside of the
       originator.   The  originator  is  this_player(),   unless
       this_player()  ==  0,  in  which  case,  the originator is
       this_object().

       The second argument is optional.  If second argument `obj'
       is specified, the message is sent to all except `obj'.  If
       `obj' is not an object, but an array of objects, all those
       objects are excluded from receiving the message.

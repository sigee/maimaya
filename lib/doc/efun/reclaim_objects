       Cycles  through all objects that are loaded, and frees any
       lingering objects that it can.  This  could  result  in  a
       sizable  amount of memory being freed up, depending on how
       the mud is coded.  Objects are  typically  left  lingering
       when  a global variable in more than one object contains a
       pointer to it, and the object gets destructed.  This  efun
       returns  the  number  of destructed objects encountered in
       variables.

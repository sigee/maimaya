       function_profile()  -  get  function profiling information
       for an object

       Returns  function  profiling  information  for  `ob',   or
       this_object()  if  `ob'  is  not  specified.  This is only
       available  if  the   driver   was   compiled   with   PRO-
       FILE_FUNCTIONS defined.

       An array of mappings is returned, one for each function in
       `ob', the format of the mapping is:
              ([ "name"     : name_of_the_function,
                 "calls"    : number_of_calls,

                 /* cpu time expressed in microseconds */
                 "self"     : cpu_time_spent_in self,
                 "children" : cpu_time_spent_in_children
              ])
       The usefulness of this is tied to the  resolution  of  the
       CPU clock--even though the units are microseconds, the CPU
       timer resolution is often much less

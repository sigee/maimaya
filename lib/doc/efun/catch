       catch() - catch an evaluation error

       Evaluate  <expr>.  If there is no error, 0 is returned. If
       there is a standard error, a string (with a  leading  '*')
       will be returned.

       The  function  throw()  can  also  be  used to immediately
       return any value, except 0. catch() is not really a  func-
       tion call, but a directive to the compiler.

       The  catch()  is  somewhat  costly, and should not be used
       just anywhere.  Rather, use it at places  where  an  error
       would destroy consistency.

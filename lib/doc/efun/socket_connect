       The argument s is a socket. s must be either a STREAM mode
       or a MUD mode socket. address is the address to which  the
       socket  will  attempt to connect.  address is of the form:
       "127.0.0.1 23"

       The argument read_callback is the name of a  function  for
       the  driver  to  call  when  the socket gets data from its
       peer. The read callback should follow this format:

              void read_callback(int fd, mixed message)

       Where fd is the socket which received the data,  and  mes-
       sage is the data which was received.

       The  argument write_callback is the name of a function for
       the driver to call when the socket is ready to be  written
       to. The write callback should follow this format:

              void write_callback(int fd)

       Where fd is the socket which is ready to be written to.

       This  function  breaks a continous string without newlines
       into a a string with newlines inserted at  every  `len':th
       character.

       If  `indent'  is  defined  and  is  given  as  an integer,
       `indent' number of spaces are inserted  after  every  new-
       line.  If  `indent'  is  a  string that string is inserted
       before every newline.

       If the first argument is an integer, the  function  simply
       returns 0.

       break_string()  is  *not*  context sensitive.  It does not
       take account of periods  '.'  and  new-lines  '\n'.   This
       means  that  the  result is not necessarily what you would
       expect.  My experience is that you should  use  one  space
       after a period and do not embed new-lines in the text, but
       append them to the result of break_string().  If this for-
       mat  does not meet your tastes you may find break_string()
       to be inadequate.  A future revision of break_string() may
       allow different line-breaking semantics.  (Cygnus)

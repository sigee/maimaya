       Get the replacement of one syntactic pattern. The  pattern
       is on the form:

                 "function[:filename][|arg1|arg2....|argN]"

       The returned value can be of any type.

       Note  that  both  object and arguments are marked optional
       with the brackets and that the brackets are  not  included
       in the actual pattern.

       This  is  usually used to support 'value by function call'
       in the mudlib.  It is wise to set  the  effuserid  of  the
       object  to 0 before using process_value as any function in
       any object can be called with almost any arguments.

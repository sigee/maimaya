       If an object that identifies to the name `str' is present,
       then return it.

       `str' can also be an object, in which  case  the  test  is
       much faster and easier.

       If `ob' is given, then the search is done in the inventory
       of `ob', otherwise the  object  is  searched  for  in  the
       inventory  of  the current object, and in the inventory of
       the environment of the current object.

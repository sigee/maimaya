       replace_program()  replaces  the  program in this_object()
       with that of an object it inherits.  The  string  argument
       is the filename of the object whose program is to be used.
       Once the  replacement  takes  place,  the  current  object
       effectively becomes a clone of that other object, but with
       its current filename and global variable values. The  pro-
       gram  is not actually replaced until the current execution
       is completed.

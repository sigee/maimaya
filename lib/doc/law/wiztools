Here is the current rule on the production of wiztools:

Wiztools are defined as objects meant only to be used by
immortals.  Wiztools no longer require approval, however their
powers are limited.  A wiztool may not call a function on a player.
(this doesn't include query_ functions)
A wiztool must not attempt to compromise the security on the MUD.
A wiztool must not attempt to circumnavigate already logged immortal
commands.
You may not log a person with a wiztool.
A wiztool that does not follow these rules will be erased WITHOUT
NOTICE.  If you have a question of whether or not a tool of yours
is legal, contact the head of the law department.
Also, a wiztool that receives a lot of complaints from players
may be requested to be removed.

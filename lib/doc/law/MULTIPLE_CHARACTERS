The rules for multiple characters are defined in 
/doc/library/multiple_characters.  Please read that file for any 
info you may need.  It is legal for wizards to have a multiple 
character although you may be watched more strictly than the 
standard mortal, given that your extra character is a wizard.  
You may not exchange any information from your wizard character to 
your mortal.  Any transfer of information in that direction constitutes 
a matter that LAW will definatly be paying you a visit for.
Even though you are a wizard, you must still abide by the 1 hour 
between login times.  Sorry.  Any further questions, please mail me and ask.

Ok, it has come to my attention that some wizards are only
playing their second characters.  I think you know who you are.
There will now be the following rule against this:

Any wizard who does not show a signifigant amount of work
within a month's time, that is found to be using his/her
second character a great deal, will lose his/her second character.

'signifigant amount' is as defined by Approval, and is
different for each case of wizard.

Questions to the incumbant Law archwizards.

This file is on player interaction, if it's outdated, send me a message and
I'll fix it up.

RULES:
1.  Do not harass others.  We're all here to have fun, don't ruin someone else's
enjoyment of the game.  This includes sexual harassment, abusive 'tell'ing, and
other such ways of annoying the people around you.
The management will not allow you to drive off other players, and will take
whatever means neccassary to stop you.

2.  Do not steal someone else's kill.  I realise this rule is really bendable,
however it has to be said.  If you know someone else is working on a monster,
don't steal it.  We might go to a shout-claim system in the future.

3.  Have fun!  This is a GAME, you're here to enjoy yourself.  Don't take it
seriously.

The concept of high mortal is still undergoing a formative process.
High mortals have their own set of commands, which include such abilities
as limited teleport, setting their title, setting their login place, and
so on.  But the concept of high mortal is meant to be something more than
being able to kill more monsters and have more commands to use.  It is
about trying to create a goal in this game for people who are not in
the least bit interested in learning to code, or in coding itself, yet
what to make a more in depth contribution to this game other than
slaying the most powerful monsters.

High mortals join together with creators to create new guilds.  Once such
a guild is put through the approval process and brought into the game,
that high mortal is guildmaster of the guild.  High mortals also may
purchase tracts of land which they may call their own.

As noted, the concept is still in its formative stage.  Any ideas should
be mailed in the following manner:

The mailer will automatically expand the groups to mail to the appropriate
people.

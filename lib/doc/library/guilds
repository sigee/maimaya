Nightmare guilds are run by the players.  Each guild is owned
by a player through purchase.  That player is in full control of the
guild, adding new players, removing them, and purchasing new guild powers.
A player may use any criteria for adding and removing guild members,
although each guild does have restrictions which define membership.

Guilds are meant to provide specialized callings to enhance the
general way you have chosen through your class membership.  The class
always remains the player's primary source of power.  The guild serves to
create a social environment with a few highly specialized powers.

A guild comes into being when a Nightmare creator creates one
either alone or at the request of a high mortal.  Once the guild is
built, it is then placed out for open auction with a minimum bid set.
The highest bidder gets to buy the guild and becom its owner.  A high mortal
who is a guild leader and chooses immortality must sell the guild to
another player.

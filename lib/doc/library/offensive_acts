                            Offensive Acts
                written by Descartes of Borg 930303

This book defines for the purposes of Nightmare an offensive act.
Please understand that we have no sympathy for the hypersensitive here.
For instance, if I state beliefs about God which might run contrary to your
beliefs, you may be offended, but Nightmare does not consider my statements
offensive.  An offensive act is defined in the following way:
    An action or statement which depicts in a negative way any physical
    trait.

Examples (not comprehensive) of physical traits:
    gender, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental handicaps

There is NOTHING in this definition about belief.  Everyone is free to 
express their beliefs so long as the expression of the belief does not
violate the rules of Nightmare.  This means if you are racist, you best
not express your beliefs or you will be out of here.  But if you happen
to believe for or against abortion, then you are free to express those
beliefs even though some hypersensitive people might find those beliefs
offensive.  Similarly, not the difference between saying something which
is anti-semetic and saying something offensive to some Jewish people.
To say something against Jews as an ethnic group is anti-semetic and falls
as a violation of mud rules.  To say something against beliefs which are
considered Jewish, however, is fully acceptable.  I only use Judiasm as
an example, because it is a good example of where sometimes beliefs may
get crossed with physical makeup (in this case, ethnic origin).

Why have we made this rule?  Because our players (we hope) are made up of
a wide variety of real life people.  This is a game for them to come and enjoy
and perhaps even get away from some of the hatred of the world outside.
People should not be subjected to that hatred here.  And we simply will not
tolerate it.

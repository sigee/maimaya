Attempting to get even with someone who gives information to the Law
department by killing them, having them killed or harrassing them is illegal.
Anytime you suspect something like this has occured, report it immediatly
to the Law department.  It will be up to Law whether
or not they feel that this has actually occured.

Questions to me,

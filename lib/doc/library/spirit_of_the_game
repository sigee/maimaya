Spirit Of the Game
------------------

The Administration of Nightmare has the right to stop any player from
violating the spirit of the game Nightmare.
Spirit of the game is interpretted by the law
department at Nightmare, direct questions to them.

What this means is, if you do behavior that might technically
be legal, but in fact harms the game or is harmful to game
balance, you will be stopped.

This does NOT include using skills like stealing, as this
is a part of the game, even though it may be used against players

Also note: We realize it may be difficult for people
to know offhand if something violates the spirit.
You will *always* be warned and asked to stop before any other action
takes place.

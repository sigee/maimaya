These are legal, however they are very very very very
very very very very very annoying to do.
We hate doing them.  It makes us very angry and frustrated.
Unless there's a really really good reason name change
requests probably won't be done.

Any requests to have your character removed should be mailed
to Manny.  Beware, however, that once you mail him the request will not be
undone.  Please note: Changing your name by starting over is
fine, just be sure to have your first character removed.

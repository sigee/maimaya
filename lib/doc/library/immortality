Unlike most muds, Nightmare does not require a player
to reach a specific level in order to obtain the right to create
an area on Nightmare.  Nightmare, instead, has much more sane requirements
for immortality.  Be warned before you ask for immortality, that
you are no longer a player in the game.  Your job is to code, not to
play or socialize.  It is a whole different thing as an immortal.
To become immortal:
1) Make sure you have thouroughly expolored the game.
You should have died a few times, and know things about ALL of the different
realms and domains.
2) You mail the advocate asking for the privelidge to code on Nightmare.
Nightmare.
3) If the circumstances are right (we are not filled with newbie
immortals, you have not been in trouble with law, we feel that you are prepared
to spend quality time coding, etc), then you will be told to wait
24 hours to take a test demonstrating your knowledge of the mud.
4) You take the test, if you pass, you will be promoted to "new immortal"
with rights to read the mud documentation.  You must take at least 24 hours
more (you may take more time) to read that documentation (law and approval
documentation).  In that time you must also find yourself a mentor to
sponsor your immortality and help you as long as you are immortal.
5) Your sponsor will give you a second test to see that you have read the 
docs.  If you pass, you will be made immortal with the priveledge of
being able to create a realm for Nightmare.

The arches of this mud consider sexual harrassment any emotes, feelings,
language, or other communication which is used to violate the person of 
another player, as if that emote, feeling, language, or communication were
taken in real life.

This means that you should never use some of the following feelings with
players you do not know:
    lick       french     fondle     spank     grope     rub
    stroke     touch      kiss       nibble    caress

This is not a comprehensive list.  It is meant to make it
clear to any particularly dense people what we will not tolerate.

By the way, if you think male bashing is any better than female bashing
then you are not only wrong but you are just as sexist as males bashing
on females.  We will treat both sides of the gender as equal.

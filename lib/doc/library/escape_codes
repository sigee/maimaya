The use of escape codes to do anything other than coloring or beeping
is expressly forbidden and will result in removal of the offender.
Beeping cannot be used over public channels, as it tends to annoy
people on the channel who aren't meant to receive the beep.


This isn't really an 'escape code' but I couldn't think of a better
place to put this.  Recently people have been using wraparound to fake
messages as being from other people or things.  This is abuse of the
system and may result in privaledges being taken away
from the abuser.

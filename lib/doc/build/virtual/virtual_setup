Virtual rooms is a different way to create rooms.  The rooms are not programmed
individually, but controlled by a server.  When a room is called that has not
been previously loaded, the master.c file on the mud calls the virtual.c file
located in the same directory (/adm).  The virtual.c file handles the compiling
of rooms that do not have files for them.  It checks to see if there is a
server in the directory which the file was called and if there isn't it loads
the default to handle the loading of the room.
 
Files Required:
/adm/master.c with the compile_object() function
/adm/virtual.c to handle the server calls
/std/virtual/compile.c inherited in the servers on your mud
 
Then depending on what you set your default filename to you must have a
_server.c file.  Of course, you could edit out the default in the virtual.c
file and do away with any default.
 
Redefine your #def statements to accomodate the new directories that the
files reside in.  There are two #def statements.  One is in master.c for
the virtual file and the other is in the virtual file for you default
_server.

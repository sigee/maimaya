To set up virtual rooms for your area you must make a virtual directory
from your main directory.

Ie: mkdir /wizards/hanse/virtual

Next, copy the file in this directory "server.c" to that directory.

Then, take a look at the field_server.c file in this directory.  It
shows how to create the server for an infinite field of rooms all
with the same description.  The exits lead out to the rooms north, west
east, and south by adding to the correct coordinate in the filename.

query_short and query_long were redefined in the server because of
a strange problem of having the mapping ob_data cleared in the room.

Make your own server and name it whatever you want plus _server.c and
put it in your virtual directory.  It must inherit /std/room.c and
/std/virtual/compile.c.

Before you code:

So many people ask if they can ftp in a castle they have coded somewhere else
The answer is simply NO NO NO.
We want everything here on Nightmare to be unique, and therefore important is
out of the question.  So don't even ask.

Explore Nightmare and get to know not only the general layout of the base
mud, but also be aware of what other castles exist in what places, and
exactly where those castles lead to.  If somone on eroad 3 has a castle
that leads south, it is just as fooloish to put a castle on eroad2 going
southeast as it would be to put another castle on eroad3 going south.
Think about the physical layout of the mud, and don't start coding an
area that conflicts with the law two objects cannot occupy the same space
at the same time.

Second come up with something creative, and find the best domain for it.  If
there simply are no domains in which this idea may fit, then code a small
spectacular area for us to approve.  It should demonstrate the best of what
you can do.  This will be considered an area of yours, and you will need to
fit it in some domain or another.  If we see that you have above average
coding abilities, then we will grant you liscense to work create a domain for
the mud.  This domain must be of top quality.  If you create a domain up to
approval's standards for domains, you will be promoted to elder and made
the elder of that domain.  You can then build your area off that domain.  If
you are a first time immortal, do not even consider this option until after
you have opened an area of substantial quality.
Third, make it not only unique on this mud... but unique to any mud.  We would
rather you spend a lot of time paying attention to detail and creativity
than making a bunch of quick rooms with identical descriptions and monsters
in an instant.
Begin coding:

Code your castle first.  Don't concern yourself with a quest or guild
immediately, especially if you are a newbie wiz.  Quests and guilds are things
that come out best when they have sat in your mind for a while.

So you are working on your castle.
Spend time thinking about what would really happen in that room if it existed
in real life.  If you have a sign in a room, make it READable.  Mud is a
text oriented game, so make the text good, not repititious.  ANY noun
in your room description should have a counterpart in the items array.
A description in the singular must be given as well if the noun is in the 
plural.

Example:  A room has a table and two chairs.  Describe the table.  Describe
the plural chairs (e.g. there are two of them and they make a set).
Describe one of the chairs (e.g. It is a nice wicker chair.)  Also 
describe anything that is mentioned in a description (e.g. The wicker is
painted white.)

You also must remember to add ctions to rooms which merit it.
If there are chairs in the room, make an action which allows them to be
sat in.  If there is a lamp, let it be turned on.  If there is a cliff,
allow it to be jumped off of.  8)
Be imaginative as far as weapons armours and treasures are concerned.  Don't
make another suit of chainmail.  Give it a name.  Let players know what it
is through the long description.  Do not try to code the best piece of
armour of the best sword on the mud!  Players should have to find the
weapon that is best for them.  An example might be a suit of armour that
has a high ac for good women, medium ac for good men, bad ac for evil women,
and horribly cursed ac for evil men.  Try to specialize your better weapons
to a monster or group of monsters (see the orc slayer in /room/orc_treasure.c)
A thieves dagger might be a great weapon for thieves and lousy for everyone
else.

Do you wanna add a shop or pub?  Make sure 1) it fits the area and 2) the
area can hold it.  A pub or shop, for instance should not be sitting in a grave
yard.  Also if you have a very small area, having a pub or shop is pointless.
Make sure the pub fits the rules for healing.


ONE MORE THING ALWAYS inherit "std/room";


Ready for approval?
The first thing you must do is mail approval and the elder in charge of the
domain in which you are building.  To do so, <mail approval qc> and cc to.
the elder. An arch from balance and QC needs to check your area, as well as
the elder. Mail your requests for approval.  No tells or coming to our work
us to check it out.  In the mail give us a general description of the area and
what is in it.  We also need to know what room is is opening into in the domain
as well as what is the first room of the area.
And we will take our time approving it, because we will be checking every
single room.  You did not code your castle in a day, and
we cannot possibly approve it in a day.
We will mail you when we have finished looking at the area.  Do not ask about
it until then.

The mud now uses the message() efun for everything.  write(), say(),
shout() tell_room(), and tell_object() are all redefined using this efun.
Eventually tell_room() and tell_object() will be removed altogether.
First, valid Nightmare message classes:

info: information, like lists, menus, etc.
more: Information being sent out a page at a time.
prompt: Prompts.
help: For help information
talk: local communications like say, whipser, etc.
tell: remote communication like tell (not including channels)
<channel name>: the name of a communcation channel is its class
environment: An event happening in the environment, like the sun going down
my_action: Text describing an action I have taken
other_action: Text describing an action others have taken
system: wizard command output, like ls, etc.
shout: Text being displayed to all users
broadcast: same as shout, except that it cannot be blocked by codeblock
smell: Text describing area olfactory input
listen: Text describing area auditory input
room_description: Text describing area visual iinput
room_exits: Text describing room exits
living_item: Text describing a living item
inanimate_item: Text describing non-living items

room_description, room_exits, living_item, inanimate_item are ONLY for use by
the user object

Message class which are not affected by blocking:
broadcast, info, more, room_description, room_exits, smell, listen, system,
prompt, inanimate_item, living_item

All text is wrapped automatically EXCEPT in the following situations:
If the message class starts with "N".  Example: "Ninfo"
If you use the efuns: printf() or notify_fail()
If the message is of class "prompt".

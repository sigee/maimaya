You may find examples of monsters already built in /obj/mon.

What must be done in each and every monster!:
To build a monster, you must first inherit "/std/monster";
In the create functions, you must call the following functions IN ORDER!:

set_name("beggar");  //  Please use a single noun for set name so that 
			 intelligent objects can use phrases like "a beggar".
			 This function simply gives the monster a generic
			 name. (Also see set_proper_name()) //

set("id", ({ "beggar", "poor beggar", "a poor beggar", "a beggar" }) );
		    //	 These are the things a player must type to make 
			 reference to the monster, as in look at poor beggar.
			 You can have any number of id's inside the ({ }),
			 but make sure you separate them by , and enclose them
			 in "".  For advanced information, this is an example
			 of an array. //

set_level( 4 );	    //	 This actually does a lot of things besides setting the
			 monster's level, and that is why you should call it
			 before you call other things.  Besides making the
			 beggar 4th level, it also sets all other attributes
			 necessary to keep the beggar MINIMALLY balanced.
			 To name a few examples, this will set the monster's
			 skills and stats to a minimum level for a level 4 
			 monster.  It will set the monster exp to the level
			 of a fourth level player, and so on.  //

set("short", "a poor beggar" ); //  This sets the desc you see when you enter a
				  room with the monster in it.

set("long", "He is a poor pathetic beggar looking for a few coins." );
		    //   This sets the decription you see when you look at
			 the monster.

set("race", "human" ); //	 This makes the monster a member of a certain race.
			 See /doc/build/races for a list of races.  This
			 list is never complete, and it is meant to be added
			 to, but any time you want to add a race that is not
			 on the list, mail APPROVAL so that the race can be
			 added to the list. //

set_gender( "male" ); // The old version used numbers to indicate gender.
			 Nowadays gender is set with a string.  Acceptable 
			 strings are "male", "female", "neuter".  Make sure
			 you set this, as a neuter knight is a silly thing.

Either :
set_body_type("human");    *or*     add_limb("head", "FATAL", 20, 0, 4);
			 // Let's start from the back up.  In the 
			 Nightmare 3.0 limb combat system, you must create
			 a body for a monster.  You do this by adding limbs.
			 set_body_type() automatically adds the limbs used
                         by the player race you pass, or by the monster
                         body type you pass as an arg.  Examples:
                         set_body_type("artrell") set_body_type("quadruped")
			 If you want ANY odd combination, you must add_limb
			 from scratch.  If you simply want two heads for a
			 two headed giant, set_body_type("human") and add a
			 "right head" or something.  You cannot have two limbs
			 with the same name.  Now the meaning of the stuff in
			 add_limb():
			 add_limb( limb_name, referent_limb, max_dam, dam, ac);
			 The limb_name is self explanatory, it gives the limb
			 a name, like "right forepaw".
			 referent_limb is the name of any limb that must
			 necessarily be lost if this one is.  For example,
			 if you lose your "right arm" you WILL lose you
			 "right hand".  So in adding the "right arm", you
			 put "right hand as the referent limb.  If no limb
			 will be lost, put "".  If the loss of the limb = death
			 put "FATAL".  Fatal limbs must have AT LEAST half of
			 the damage taking ability as the monster has hp.
			 max_dam is the maximum amount of damage the limb can
			 take before being lost.  As I just said, for fatal
			 limbs, this number should be 1/2 (at least) the 
			 monster's hp.
			 dam is the amount of damage the monster is starting
			 with on the limb.  In this way you can creatively
			 make wounded monsters, great for newbie areas.
			 ac is the ac of the limb.  Limbs should have an ac
			 at least = to the monster's level in low levels and
			 right at the monster level at high levels.

set_overall_ac( 4 ); //  This sets the ac of all limbs to 4, except the torso
			 which it sets a bit higher than the number.


These are all of the functions minimally necessary to create a monster.
However, just using these functions will not help you get a monster past
QC, as they will be dull monsters set up for hack and slash.  Below is a
listing of optional functions you may put in code to individualize your monster.
******************************************************************************

set_wielding_limbs( ({ "right hand", "left hand" }) );
		    //	 Sets the limbs in which a monster
		    	 is able to wield a weapon.

set_ac("right hand", 7); // Sets the ac of a limb to a certain number.

set_fingers(5);	    //	 Gives the monster fingers.  Necessary to have the 
			 monster wear rings.

set_moving(1); 
*and*
set_speed(60);	    //	 Makes the monster a wandering monster.  1 MUST be
			 the argument to moving, whereas speed is how often
			 the monster moves in seconds.  ALL wandering
			 monsters on Nightmare MUST be intelligent monsters.
			 This means they have to respond to external stimuli
			 beyond kill.  Their wandering needs a purpose.

set_max_hp(100);    //   Sets the maximum number of hit points a monster
			 may have. You would set this if you want to create
			 a monster that is wounded and can heal.

set_hp(50);	    //	 Sets how many hp the monster has.  The function
			 will not allow you to set it below a certain number
			 depending on the level of the monster.

set_max_sp(400);      // Sets the maximum number of stamina points

set_sp(300);          // Sets the starting stamina points

set_exp(1000);	    //	 Sets how many experience points the monster has, and
			 therefore its worth to the player.  Thois function
			 is mostly useless to the immortal, since it will not
			 allow you to set it above the default setting.  But
			 if you want to make a 20th level monster yielding
			 no exp, set_exp(0); is the way to do it.

set_skill("melee", 20) // Sets a given skill to a certain number.  This will
			  not allow you to set the stat below its default
			  setting.  This is useful for creating monsters that
			  pick pockets, steal, or (in the future, I hope)
			  caste mage, monk, or cleric spells.
			  YOU MUST USE THIS IF YOU WISH THE MONSTER TO WIELD
			  A WEAPON EFFECTIVELY.  Otherwise Balance will have
			  you shot :)

set_stats("strength", 15) // Sets a monster stat value.

set_class("cleric");   // Makes the monster a member of a certain class.  I
			  hope to make this important later, by allowing the
			  monsters with set_class to do class-like things.

set("aggressive", 10)     *or*     set("aggressive", "special_func");
            // If you pass a number, then it will have the monster 
               automatically attack anyone with a charisma lower than that
               number.  If you pass a string, then it will look for a
               function by the name of the string passed to call (you write
               the function and specify what you want to happen when the
               monster encounters a player).  This is useful for making 
               monsters which only attack rogues or artrells or whatever.

set_wimpy(20);	    //	 Makes the monster wimp out at 20% of its max_hp

set_wimpydir("out"); //  Makes "out" the preferred direction of wimping out.
			 Keep in mind that if you set out and there is no out,
			 it will search for a direction that is there.

set_spell_chance(30); // Sets the percent chance the monster has during an
			 and attack for each round for casting a spell.

set_spells( ({ "missile", "shock", "fireball" }) );
		      // Sets up a list of possible commands the monster
			 can execute during combat.  Note that game defined
			 attack spells need no argument during combat.  But
			 other spells, like heal spells, stealing, and
			 immortal defined spells need any appropriate arguments
			 Remember that the monster needs the right amount of
			 magic points in order to cast a spell.  Also, some
			 spells require the monster to be a member of a certain
			 class.  And if you want the monster to cast the spell
			 effectively, remember to set that skill.

set_languages( ({ "farsi", "borgish" }) );
                        Makes the monster be able to speak each of these
                        languages fluently.  A monster needs to be able
                        to speak a language fluently in order ALWAYS to
                        understand the utterances of another fluent speaker
                        in the same language (for insteance, when you use
                        set_speech() or define catch_tell())

set_lang_prof("nibelungen", 7);
                        Useful for making a monster partially adept
                        at a given language.  (fluency range: 1-10)

set_emotes(20, ({"The beggar grovels a bit.","The beggar whines."}), 0);
                        This sends emotes and other messages to the room.
                        Every heart beat, this beggar will have a 20% chance
                        (the first arg) of sending out randomly one of these
                        messages.  The third argument is either 1 or 0.
                        1 means the message is for combat, 0 is for peace.

set_speech(20, "farsi", ({"I have nothing to sell.", "My brain hurts."}),0);
                        Much like set_emotes(), except this sets up text
                        which the monster will randomly try to speak using
                        the speak command.  Of course, the monster must
                        already have had set_lang_prof() or set_languages()
                        set for the language (in this case "farsi") being
                        spoken.


set_achats(20, ({ "The beggar bleeds on you.\n", "The beggar spits on you.\n" }) );		    \\ This is the same as set_chats(), except that these chats
			are given while the monster is engaged in combat.

*******************************************************************************

Functions outside of create() that you define:

void catch_tell(string str) { }

Whenever anything is done in a room, like you give bozo a flower, the function
tell_object is used to tell:
you: You give Bozo a flower.
Bozo: Descartes gives you a flower.
anyone else in the room: Descartes gives Bozo a flower.

The string given by tell_object() to a monster will go to the function
catch_tell if it exists in the monster, so that, if Bozo is a monster, then
str in our catch tell: str = "Descartes gives you a flower."
inside catch_tell, you can do whatever you want with this string, the most
common user is to use a function called sscanf() to search for keywords in
the monster.  I am adding a function to monster.c called interact
usage: interact(str1, str2);
If str1 is in str2, the the function will return 1, if not 0;
So we could test to see if Bozo is getting a sword by the following:
if(interact("gives", str)) {
    if(interact("you", str)) {
	if(interact("sword", str)) {
		if(present("sword")) tell_room(environment(this_object(), "Bozo says: Thank you!\n");
	}
    }
}

You need to check in the case of gives that it was actually a giving, and no
emote was used.  Make sure you do not have the monster respond by teling
a phrase that would in turn cause it to respond again.  You can always
exempt the monster from being told what you are telling the room with the
following syntax:

tell_room(environment(this_object()), string_to_be_told, ({ this_object() }) );

Please note that I put a syntax error in my tell room in the Bozo example.
there is a missing ).  But the tell_room example I just gave is correct.

Please see /doc/efun/tell_room, /doc/lfun/catch_tell, /doc/lfun/interact,
/doc/efun/tell_object

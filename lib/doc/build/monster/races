The following is a list of races.  It is not intended to be comprehensive,
But if you have a monster of one of these races do not call it something 
else.  If you have a monster of race not listed here, mail it to me.
People should be coding weapons that hit special against monsters of
certain races, like a dragonslayer and such.

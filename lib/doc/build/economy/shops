Creating a shop on Nightmare is much simpler than it is on most muds, even
though the economic system is a bit more complex.  This is because we have
an inheritable shopkeeping monster called /std/vendor.c
In this vendor is all of the code that would be needed by any buy/sell shop.
Unfortunately, it is not as simple as inheriting the monster code.
In addition to inheriting and customizing the monster for your needs, you have
to build the room in which the monster will be placed (the shop)
and a storage area for all items the shop has for sale.  These are just simple
rooms.

Necessary things to set in vendor.c
------------------------------------

see /doc/build/monsters/tutorial for info on the monster customizing settings
that are necessary and optional.  All info in that tutorial is applicable
here as well, since the vendor inherits monster.c

set_currency("gold");
	This function tells the inheritable vendor what kind of currency it
	is to accept in its shop.  Each area on Nightmare is supposed to
	accept only one type of currency.  The vendor automatically does
	all conversions into its currency.

set_storage_room("/domains/standard/storage");
	This tells the vendor where all the items to be sold are stored.

set_skill("bargaining", 90);
	The price a player gets for selling an object, or is charged for 
	buying one is related a: to the players bargaining skill, b: to the
	vendor's bargaining skill, c: to the player's charisma.
	So it is therefore necessary that you set the vendor's bargaining.
	No shop may have a vendor with a bargaining skill lower than 125.

That's it :)  Now you have a shop!

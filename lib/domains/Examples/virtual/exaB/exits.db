# Comment  :  This data base defines which rooms connect to which
#               O is a normal room
#               * is an exceptional room (exceptions.c is called)
#               |/-\ indicate where rooms have exits to each other
#               the ... boarder is just so you included enough spaces
#             The virtual area can be of any size, but you must alter
#             terrs.db as well, so each room has a description.
